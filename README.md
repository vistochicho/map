# CompuSpot

This app allows you to find any Computer Shop that were not available within Google Maps.<br>
The app's currently not finished yet, as it's still using google free api, localhost database and i have yet to upload the php files, so yeah.

The reason why i created this app was because from a real-life experience where i'm trying to find a Computer Shop and lost on the way because the path that was shown by the Google Maps was incorrect and the place were not Available.

This app was created for my final exams.
